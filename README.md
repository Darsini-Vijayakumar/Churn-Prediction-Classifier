Project Overview and Insights
---------------------------------------------

**1. Project Objective**

The objective of this project is to predict customer churn for a company. Churn prediction is vital for a business to identify potential losses of customers and implement strategies to retain them, thereby ensuring sustainability and growth.

**2.Dataset**
The dataset used in this project contains customer information from a company, captured in a file named churn_data.xlsx. The dataset includes various customer attributes such as tenure, preferred login device, city tier, distance from the warehouse to home, preferred payment mode, gender, hours spent on the app, number of devices registered, preferred order category, satisfaction score, marital status, number of addresses, complaint flags, order amount hike from last year, coupons used, order count, days since the last order, and cashback amount.

**3.Approach**

An initial exploration of the data are performed along with.
Different Classifer performances were observed:
 1.Logistc
 2.Decision Tree
 3.Random Forest
 4.Gradient Boosting
 5.SVM

**4. Results**
Given these results, the Random Forest model could be considered the best candidate for predicting customer churn, due to its robustness and ability to handle imbalanced datasets effectively.
